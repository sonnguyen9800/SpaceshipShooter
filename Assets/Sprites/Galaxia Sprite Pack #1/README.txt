README

First of all, thank you for purchasing! I hope these sprites give you a head start in prototyping your very own game.

[PROVIDED FEATURES]

- 13 Enemy Sprite Variants
- 3 Player Sprites

[SET-UP]

There is no initial set-up! All sprites have been cut and set appropriately, just assign them to a new gameobject to get started!

If you're looking for a code base to lay some groundwork on your very own space shooter head over to the 2D Space Shooter Template available on the asset store! You can drag and drop these 
sprites onto any existing or new gameobjects with no fuss.
